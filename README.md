# Hands-on-Machine-Learning-using-Keras-and-TensorFlow

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for learning MachineLearning using Keras and TensorFlow.

In chapter 10, we start from the basics of Deep learning and learn the working of Artificial Neural Networks with Keras and train our very first Neural Network.

In chapter 11, we train Deep Neural Networks and look at the different challenges that one may face while trying to train a Network and how to overcome those challenges.

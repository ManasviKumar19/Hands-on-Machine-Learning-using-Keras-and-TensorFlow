# Hands-on-Machine-Learning-using-Keras-and-TensorFlow

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for learning MachineLearning using Keras and TensorFlow.

In chapter 10, we start from the basics of Deep learning and learn the working of Artificial Neural Networks with Keras and train our very first Neural Network.

In chapter 11, we train Deep Neural Networks and look at the different challenges that one may face while trying to train a Network and how to overcome those challenges.

In chapter 12, we build custom layers, custom functions, custom metrics and custom Models for our specific use cases.

In chapter 13, we look at how we can load and pre-process data with TensorFlow on the fly and learn about the Data API and TRF.
